        <p>Question of the Day was designed with one thing in mind: Connecting people together by harnessing the power of lanuage; of writing.</p>
        <p>Founded by Matt Schwartz in 2016, QtD asks a daily subjective question (No trivia, no right or wrong answers- exclusively responses that are right for YOU) that can range from "What color shirt are you wearing today?" all the way to "What is the meaning of life?" Questions post every morning at 12am EST.</p>
        <p>There are no character limits.  There are no rules.  Choose who you want to follow, be it friends, celebrites, celebrities you're friends with, talking mimes, even Nicolas Cage (because, let's face it, we all would really like to know what's going on inside that guy's head) and check out their answers to the daily question.</p>
        <p>After all, isn't that what Social Media is all about?  Sharing your thoughts with the world?  Well, thanks to QtD, TODAY is your chance.</p>
